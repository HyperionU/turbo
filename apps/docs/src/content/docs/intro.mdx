Welcome! From all of us at the University of Hyperion, 
we are so excited that you are able to develop some of the most important projects yet.

U of H's platform consists of two parts:
- **Website**: This allows students to access resources and U of H projects for free.
- **HyperionUI**: A UI kit from Hyperion University.
- **Nitrox DevKit**: <Badge text='Experimental' variant='danger'/> This lets others add on for free for anyone out there in need.

## Key Features
Here's what makes us special:

- **No-brainer for UI**: You concentrate on the notes, we focus on the UI.
- **Collaborate with our community**: Build your notes, share with our community, and get inspired by others.
- **Quick to Start**: While there may be some strong nuance, getting started is the easiest thing.
- **Performance**: Since this exports to Pure HTML, there is no JavaScript, meaning faster times.

A quick overview of where to find what in our docs:
- **Basics**: Go over this section to learn how to build notes in our step-by-step guides.
- **Examples**: Kickstart your extension by using an open-source example and learn as you go.
- **Information**: Get the background knowledge to master your understanding of our platform.
- **Utilities**: A set of utilities to streamline common patterns and operations used in extensions.

Now, let's build ðŸ’ª.
